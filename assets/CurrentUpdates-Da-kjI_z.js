I was overwhelmed with excitement as I headed towards it. To me, one of the magical parts of Burning Man is the serendipitous run-ins with people you weren’t expecting to find so far out in the middle of the desert. When I arrived on the art car, I remember feeling blown away by how many friends and familiar faces were both on the car and in the crowd. It was overwhelming to see everyone. If you were there that night, I hope listening to this set brings you back to that place. And if you are listening for the first time, I hope you can feel the magic we created together.
