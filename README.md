## Description

This is a portfolio built to showcase who I am. The application was built on a vue3/vite framework. There is an api built in that brings up a inspriational quote upon visiting. In the header you can click on the different tabs to explore. Multiple pages including my work history & resume, a brief glimpse at who I am, and even a blog page! Tailwind was used to build for css framework. Vue router was also incorporated for smooth transitions between pages.
